== Getting started with tracing

Distributed tracing is a critical feature of micro-service based applications, since it traces workflow both
within a service and across multiple services.  This gives you insight to sequence and timing data for specific blocks of work,
which helps you identify performance and operational issues.  Helidon MP includes support for distributed tracing
through the https://opentracing.io[OpenTracing API].  Tracing is integrated with WebServer, gRPC Server,
and Security using either the https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] or https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger] tracers.
The examples in this guide will use Zipkin, and traces will be viewed using both the Zipkin API and UI.

=== Create a sample Helidon MP project

Use the Helidon MP Maven archetype to create a simple project that can be used for the examples in this guide.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.Run the Maven archetype:
----
mvn archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion={helidon-version} \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
----

[source,bash]
.The project will be built and run from the `helidon-quickstart-mp` directory:
----
cd helidon-quickstart-mp
----

== Spans and Traces

A _span_ is the basic unit of work done within a single service, on a single host.  Every span has a name, starting timestamp, and duration.
A _trace_ contains a collection of spans, where spans are organized as a directed acylic graph (DAG) and can belong to multiple services,
running on multiple hosts.  The _OpenTracing Data Model_ describes the details
at https://opentracing.io/specification[The OpenTracing Semantic Specification].
For example, when you invoke a REST API call, Helidon creates a unique `trace` to track the spans.  Spans are automatically created by Helidon as needed
during execution of the REST request.  The following example demonstrates this using a simple trace.

NOTE: Helidon automatically enables tracing for JAX-RS resources methods so you don't need to use annotations with JAX-RS.

[source,bash]
Run Zipkin within a docker container:
----
.docker run -d --name zipkin -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
----

As mentioned, Helidon includes built-in support for tracing.  To enable it, you need to update the pom.xml file and
add the following to the `<dependencies>` section (*not* `<dependencyManagement>`).

[source,xml]
.Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.helidon.tracing</groupId>
  <artifactId>helidon-tracing-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,bash]
.Add the following line to `META-INF/microprofile-tracing.properties`:
----
tracing.service=helidon-mp-1
----

[source,bash]
.Build the application, skipping unit tests, then run it:
----
mvn package -DskipTests=true
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
----

[source,bash]
.Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
...
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
----

=== Viewing tracing using Zipkin REST API

Because you have tracing enable, the previous endpoint invocation resulted in a new trace being created.
Let's get the trace data that was generated using the Zipkin API.  First get the service information.

[source,bash]
.Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:9411/api/v2/services
...
["helidon-mp-1"] // <1>
----
<1> This is the tracing service name specified in `META-INF/microprofile-tracing.properties`.

Each span used by a service has a name, which is unique within a trace. If you
invoke the `/greet` endpoint multiple times, you will still get the same set
of names.

[source,bash]
.Invoke the endpoint below and check the response:
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans?serviceName=helidon-mp-1" -H "accept: application/json" // <1>
...
[ // <2>
  "content-read",
  "content-write",
  "get:io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetresource.getdefaultmessage",
  "security",
  "security:atn",
  "security:atz",
  "security:response"
]
----
<1> Get the span names for the `helidon-mp-1` service.
<2> These are the span names.  If you invoke the `/greet` endpoint again, then
invoke the `/spans` endpoint, you will get the same response.

Next, get the contents of the trace as shown below.  Notice that each span has a `parentId` field,
except the `get:io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetresource.getdefaultmessage` span,
which is the root.

[source,bash]
.Invoke the endpoint below and check the response:
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/traces?serviceName=helidon-mp-1&limit=1" -H "accept: application/json"  // <1>
...
[
  [ // <2>
    {
      "traceId": "2e0af8866efdef35",
      "parentId": "2e0af8866efdef35",
      "id": "b5d61690f230fde4",
      "kind": "SERVER",
      "name": "content-read",
      "timestamp": 1568077339998659,
      "duration": 41,
      "localEndpoint": {
        "serviceName": "helidon-mp-1",
        "ipv4": "192.168.1.115"
      },
      "tags": {
        "requested.type": "java.io.InputStream" // <3>
      }
    },
...
(truncated)
]

----
<1> Get the oldest trace only, using the `limit=1` query param.  There are other query params that let you restrict
results to a specific time window.
<2> The request will return seven spans, one for each name, along with an unamed JSON node, which
has the status.
<3> User defined tags that can be used to query and filter trace data.

=== Viewing tracing using Zipkin UI

The tracing output data is verbose and can be difficult to interpret using the REST API, especially since it represents
a structure of spans.  Zipkin offers a web-based UI at http://localhost:9411/zipkin, where you can see a visual
representation of the same data and the relationship between spans within a trace.  Click on the `Lens UI` button at the top center,
since that is the specific UI used by this guide.

The image below shows the trace summary, including start time and duration of each trace. There are two traces,
each one generated in response to a `curl http://localhost:8080/greet` invocation.

.Tracing list view
image::guides/12_tracing_top.png[Traces]

Click on a trace and you will see the trace detail page where the spans are listed.  You can clearly
see the root span and the relationship among all the spans in the trace, along with timing information.

.Trace detail page
image::guides/12_tracing_detail.png[Trace Detail]

NOTE: A parent span might not depend on the result of the child. This is called a `FollowsFrom` reference, see
https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md[Open Tracing Semantic Spec].  Notice, the
last span which writes the response after the root span ends, falls into this category.

You can examine span details by clicking on the span row.  Refer to the image below.  This view shows detailed timing information along with tags.
You can see times for each space relative to the root span.  These rows are  annotated with `Server Start` and `Server Finish`, as shown in the third column.

.Span detail page

=== Enabling Tracing on CDI beans

So far, you have used tracing with JAX-RS without needing to annotate.  You can enable tracing on other CDI beans, either at the class level
or at the method level, as shown by the following examples.

==== Tracing at the method level

To trace at the method level, you just annotate a method with @Traced.

[source,java]
.Add the @Traced annotation to the `GreetingProvider.getMessage`:
----
    @Traced  // <1>
    String getMessage() {
        return message.get();
    }
...
----
<1> This will enable tracing for getMessage.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans?serviceName=helidon-mp-1" -H "accept: application/json" // <1>
...
[
  "content-read",
  "content-write",
  "dosomework",
  "get:io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetresource.getdefaultmessage",
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage", // <2>
  "security",
  "security:atn",
  "security:atz",
  "security:response"
]
----
<1> Get the span names.
<2> There is new span name for the `getmessage` method, since your code called that method during the
invocation of `/greet`.

Click on the UI refresh button (the search icon) as shown in the image below.

.Trace refresh
image::guides/12_tracing_refresh.png[Trace Refresh]

Click on the newest trace in the list to see the trace detail page like the one below.
Notice the new span named `io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage`.

.Trace detail page with new span `getmessage`
image::guides/12_tracing_getmessage.png[Trace getmessage]


==== Tracing at the class level

To trace at the class level, annotate the class with @Traced. This will enable tracing for all class methods,
except for the constructor and private methods.

[source,java]
.Add the @Traced annotation to the `GreetingProvider` class and remove @Traced from the `getMessage` method:
----
@Traced // <1>
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {
...

    String getMessage() { // <2>
        return message.get();
    }
----
<1> This will enable tracing for all class methods, except for the constructor and methods that are private.
<2> Remove @Traced for the `getMessage` method.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the response:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans?serviceName=helidon-mp-1" -H "accept: application/json"
[
...
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage", // <1>
...
]
----
<1> The service has the same set of span names as above, since `getmessage` was the only method called in this bean.


Next, invoke HTTP PUT to change the greeting, which will cause `setMessage` to be called.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the response:
----
curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d `{"greeting": "Hi"}`  http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting // <1>
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans?serviceName=helidon-mp-1" -H "accept: application/json"
...
[
  "content-read",
  "content-write",
  "get:io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetresource.getdefaultmessage",
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage",
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.setmessage", // <2>
  "put:io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetresource.updategreeting", // <3>
  "security",
  "security:atn",
  "security:atz",
  "security:response"
]
----
<1> Invoke the endpoint to change the greeting.
<2> The `GreetingProvider.setmessage` method was traced since you enabled class level tracing.
<3> The JAX-RS method `GreetResource.updategreeting` was traced automatically by Helidon.

You can refresh the UI view and drill down the trace to see the new spans.

NOTE: Methods that invoked directly by your code are not enabled for tracing, even if you explicitly annotate them with @Traced.
Tracing only works for methods that invoked on CDI beans. See the example below.

[source,java]
.Update the `GreetingProvider` class with the following code:
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {
    private final AtomicReference<String> message = new AtomicReference<>();

    /**
     * Create a new greeting provider, reading the message from configuration.
     *
     * @param message greeting to use
     */
    @Inject
    public GreetingProvider(@ConfigProperty(name = "app.greeting") String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }

    @Traced // <1>
    String getMessage() {
        return getMessage2();
    }

    @Traced  // <2>
    String getMessage2() {
        return message.get();
    }

    void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }
}
----
<1> The `getMessage` method will be traced since it is externally invoked by `GreetingResource`.
<2> The `getMessage2` method will not be traced, even with the @Traced annotation, since it is called internally by `getMessage`.

[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the response:
----
curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d `{"greeting": "Hi"}`  http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting // <1>
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans?serviceName=helidon-mp-1" -H "accept: application/json"
...
[
...
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage", // <1>
...
]
----
<1> The `getMessage` method is traced, but `getMessage2` is not.

=== Tracing across services

Helidon automatically traces across services, providing that the services use the same tracer, for example: the same instance of Zipkin.
This means a single trace can include spans from multiple services and hosts.  A span is restricted to a single service,
but its descendents can belong to different services and hosts.  OpenTracing uses a `SpanContext` to
propagate tracing information across process bounderies.  When you make client API calls, Helidon will
internally call OpenTracing APIs to propagate the `SpanContext`. There is nothing you need to do in your application to make this work.

To demonstrate distributed tracing, you will need to create a second project, where the server listens on port 8081.
Create a new root directory to hold this new project, then do the following steps, similiar to
what you did at the start of this guide:

1. Create a project using the `helidon-quickstart-mp` archetype.
2. Add the `helidon-tracing-zipkin` dependency to the `pom.xml` file.
3. Replace `META-INF/microprofile-tracing.properties` with the following:
----
app.greeting=Hello From MP-2
tracing.service=helidon-mp-2

# Microprofile server properties
server.port=8081
server.host=0.0.0.0
----

[source,bash]
.Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response, *notice the port is 8081*:
----
curl http://localhost:8081/greet
...
{
  "message": "Hello From MP-2 World!"
}
----

Once you have validated that this second service is running correctly, you need to modify the original application to
call it.

[source,java]
.Update the `GreetResource` class with the following code:
----
package io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp;

import io.helidon.security.integration.jersey.SecureClient;
import java.util.Collections;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.json.Json;
import javax.json.JsonBuilderFactory;
import javax.json.JsonObject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.client.WebTarget;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import org.glassfish.jersey.server.Uri;

@Path("/greet")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetResource {

  @Uri("http://localhost:8081/greet")
  @SecureClient
  private WebTarget target; // <1>

  private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Collections.emptyMap());
  private final GreetingProvider greetingProvider;

  @Inject
  public GreetResource(GreetingProvider greetingConfig) {
    this.greetingProvider = greetingConfig;
  }

  @SuppressWarnings("checkstyle:designforextension")
  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
  public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
    return createResponse("World");
  }

  @GET
  @Path("/outbound") // <2>
  public JsonObject outbound() {
    return target.request().accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE).get(JsonObject.class);
  }

  private JsonObject createResponse(String who) {
    String msg = String.format("%s %s!", greetingProvider.getMessage(), who);

    return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
  }
}
----
<1> This is the `WebTarget` needed to send a request to the second service at port `8081`.
<2> This is the new endpoint that will call the second service.


[source,bash]
.Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the response:
----
curl -i http://localhost:8080/greet/outbound // <1>
...
{
  "message": "Hello From MP-2 World!" // <2>
}
----
<1> The request went to the service on `8080`, which then invoked the service at `8081` to get the greeting.
<2> Notice the greeting came from the second service.

Now view the Zipkin UI and notice that there is a trace across two services.

.Tracing multiple service list view
image::guides/12_tracing_top_2_services.png[Traces]

Click on the trace with two services to see the detail view.

.Tracing across multiple services detail view
image::guides/12_tracing_detail_2_services.png[Traces]

In the image above, you can see that the trace includes spans from two services. You will notice there is a gap before the sixth span,
which is a `get` operation. This is a one time initialization delay.  Run the `/outbound` curl command again and look at the new trace to
see that the delay no longer exists.

== Integration with Kubernetes

The following example demonstrate how to use Zipkin from a Helidon application running in Kubernetes.

[source,bash]
.Stop the application and build the docker image for your application.
----
docker build -t helidon-tracing-mp .
----

[source,bash]
.Create a Zipkin deployment, then expose it port 9142:
----
kubectl create deployment  helidon-zipkin  --image=openzipkin/zipkin
kubectl expose deployment helidon-zipkin --port=9412 --target-port=9411 --type=LoadBalancer
----

Navigate to http://localhost:9412/zipkin to validate that you can access Zipkin running in Kubernetes.

[source,yaml]
.Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `tracing.yaml`, with the following contents:
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-tracing // <1>
  labels:
    app: helidon-tracing
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-tracing
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: helidon-tracing
spec:
  replicas: 1 // <2>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-tracing
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helidon-tracing
          image: helidon-tracing-mp
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
----
<1> A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port `8080`.
<2> A deployment with one replica of a pod.

[source,bash]
.Create and deploy the application into Kubernetes:
----
kubectl apply -f ./tracing.yaml
----

[source,bash]
.Get the service information:
----
kubectl get service/helidon-tracing
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helidon-tracing   NodePort   10.99.159.2   <none>        8080:31143/TCP   8s // <1>
----
<1> A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port `31143`.

[source,bash]
.Verify the tracing endpoint using port `31143`, your port will likely be different:
----
curl http://localhost:31143/greet
...
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
----

Access the Zipkin UI at http://localhost:9412/zipkin and click on the refresh icon to see the trace that was just created.

You can now delete the Kubernetes resources that were just created during this example.

[source,bash]
.Delete the Kubernetes resources:
----
kubectl delete -f ./tracing.yaml
kubectl delete service helidon-zipkin
kubectl delete deployment helidon-zipkin
----
